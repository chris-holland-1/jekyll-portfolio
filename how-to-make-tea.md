There are many variations that go into the taste of tea, and all of them must be balanced to make a good cup. When the leaves were picked, how they were processed, the temperature of the water, the amount of tea used, the type of water used, the amount of time steeping.

The first thing to keep in mind when it comes to making tea is that there are a few general guidelines that you can use for all tea, but many variations for each individual type of tea. Even within the same kind of tea, subtle variations are common in the best way to brew. Tea is an art and a science, and just like cooking, there are no hard and fast rules. It requires experimentation, trying things out, and a development of experience and intuition over time. The world of tea is a big place to explore, and there are always new things to learn and try. Here we will share the general guidelines that can help you get started as well as some other recommendations from our own experience with makig tea.
