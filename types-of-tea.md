# What is Tea?

On a basic level, tea is made from the dried and processed leaves and buds of the *Camellia sinensis* plant which are then steeped in water to infuse it with their flavor and nutrients.

There are seven main types of tea:

* Black
* Green
* White
* Yellow
* Oolong
* Dark (also called *pu'erh*)
* Herbal (also called *tisane*)

Of these seven types, the first six are sometimes called the "true teas" because they are made from the *Camellia sinensis* plant, while the last type, herbal tea, is made from a variety of other plants. For example, some common herbal teas are chamomile, peppermint, and rooibos. It would be more accurate to call these herbal infusions rather than herbal teas because they aren't made from the tea plant, but in common usage it's convenient to call them tea because they are made in a similar way but with different ingredients. All of these types are infusions of plants, but only the first six are technically tea because they are made from the tea plant, *Camellia sinensis*.

With that technicality cleared up, let's take a look at each of these types of tea.

## Black Tea

Black teas tend to be a rich brown color with a robust flavor. Some of the most common black teas you might see are English Breakfast, Earl Grey, and Darjeeling. Black teas are often named for the region that they came from. Quote about black tea? Photos?

Of these seven types, all of them except herbal teas are made from the leaves of the tea plant, *Camellia sinensis*. These are sometimes called "true teas". Herbal teas are made in a similar way to true teas, but they are not made from the same plant. They are made from a variety of other plants depending on the tea. For example, some common herbal teas are chamomile, peppermint, and rooibos (also known as red tea). On a technical level, these herbal infusions are not actually tea because they don't . True teas are infusions as well, but they are infusions of the tea plant specifically.
