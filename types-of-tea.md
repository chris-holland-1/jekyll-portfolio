# Types of Tea

There are seven main types of tea: Black, green, white, yellow, oolong, dark (pu'erh) and herbal (tisane).

All tea is made by infusing parts of plants or other flavorful ingredients in water.

Of these seven, all of them except herbal teas are made from the leaves of the tea plant, *Camellia sinensis*. These are sometimes called "true teas". Herbal teas are made in a similar way to true teas, but they are not made from the same plant. They are made from a variety of other plants depending on the tea. For example, chamomile or peppermint. On a technical level, these herbal teas are not actually tea, but herbal infusions. True teas are infusions as well, but they are infusions of the tea plant specifically.
