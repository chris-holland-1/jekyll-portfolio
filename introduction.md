Tea is a drink with a rich history, deep cultural influence worldwide, and important implications for the daily experiences of billions of people. In this way tea is a large scale influence in the world. 

But tea is also simple. Tea is about an afternoon break and refreshed energy. Tea is about a shared moment between two people. It's on this small scale that tea has its most powerful influence. It is a small drink that hides the power to shape the world one cup at a time.

In this guide we will explore the big and small scale of tea, as well as practical information about the different types of tea and how to make it. We'll start with talking about what exactly tea is and what the different kinds are. Then we'll talk about the different ways to make tea and some guidelines for getting started. Finally, we'll talk about the history of tea, how tea influences cultures worldwide, and the connection between tea, health, and mindfulness—a connection that gives tea its lasting place as the world's favorite cup.
