# So... What is Tea?

Tea is a drink made from the tea plant, *Camellia sinensis*. *Camellia sinensis* is an evergreen plant that grows in such-and-such climates, mainly China, India, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and Japan. The leaves, buds, and stems of the tea plant are dried and processed in various ways to make the different types of tea, and they are then infused in water to make the drink.

You may have experience drinking chamomile tea or peppermint tea, or a variety of other herbal teas. While we call these drinks tea because they are made in a similar way as regular tea, it would be more accurate to call them herbal infusions because they are not made from the *Camellia sinensis* plant. Another word for this type of tea is *tisane*.
