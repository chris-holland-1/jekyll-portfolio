# Tea in Five Minutes

A perfect cup of tea can be made in about five minutes, and that's also about how long it takes to learn the basics of tea. The other sections of this guide will go into more detail, but if you're looking for the most essential points to getting started with tea, you've come to the right place.

## The key points

1. Tea comes in seven main varieties: black, green, white, oolong, yellow, dark, and herbal.
2. All tea is made from a plant called *Camellia sinensis*, except for herbal teas, which are made from a variety other plants, like chamomile and peppermint.
3. The different kinds of tea are made by varying the way the leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant are processed through drying and oxidation. In general, more oxidation makes a darker tea.

For the most common teas that you are likely to encounter, these steps are all that's needed for a great brew.

1. Heat water. A stovetop kettle or electric kettle is the best tool for this (not a microwave). For darker teas like black teas, make sure the water gets to boiling temperature, not just warm. For lighter teas like green tea, the water should be hot but not quite boiling.
2. Put the tea bag in the cup or the loose leaves into a tea strainer and then into the cup.
3. When the water is hot, pour it in the cup.
4. After 3-5 minutes for the darker teas (black, dark, herbal, and most oolongs), or 1-2 minutes for the lighter teas (green, white, yellow), remove the tea from the water. This is important. If the tea is left to brew for longer than this, it will quickly become bitter.
5. Sit back and enjoy!
