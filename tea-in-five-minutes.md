# Tea in Five Minutes

A perfect cup of tea can be made in about five minutes, and that's also about how long it takes to learn the basics of tea. The other sections of this guide will go into more detail, but if you're looking for the most essential points to getting started with tea, you've come to the right place.

## Types of tea

There are two main types of tea: true teas and herbal teas. True teas are made from the tea plant, which is called *Camellia sinensis*. There are several categories of true teas, ranging from darker black teas to lighter green and white teas. Herbal teas are technically not tea because they are not made from *Camellia sinensis*. They are made from a variety of other plants like chamomile and peppermint. A more accurate name for these would be herbal infusions, but they are often called tea because they are brewed in the same way as tea.

## How to make tea

For the most common teas that you are likely to encounter, these steps are all that's needed for a great brew.

1. Heat water. For darker teas like black teas, the water should be boiling temperature, not just warm. For lighter teas like green tea, the water should be hot but not quite boiling. A stovetop kettle or electric kettle is the best tool for this (not a microwave).
2. Put the tea bag in the cup or the loose leaves into a tea strainer and then into the cup.
3. When the water is hot, pour it in the cup.
4. After 3-5 minutes for the darker teas (black, dark, herbal, and most oolongs), or 1-2 minutes for the lighter teas (green, white, yellow), remove the tea from the water. **This is important.** If the tea is left to brew for longer than this, it will quickly become bitter.
5. Sit back and enjoy!
