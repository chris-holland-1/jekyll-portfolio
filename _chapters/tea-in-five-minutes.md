# Tea in Five Minutes

A perfect cup of tea can be made in about five minutes, and that's also about how long it takes to learn the basics of tea. The other sections of this guide will go into more detail, but here are the most essential points to get started.

## Types of tea

* All tea is made from the tea plant, which is called *Camellia sinensis*.
* There are several categories of tea, ranging from darker black teas to lighter green and white teas. These varieties are made by varying the way the leaves of the *Camellia sinensis* plant are dried and processed.
* The exception to this rule is herbal teas. Herbal teas are made from a variety of other plants like chamomile and peppermint. A more accurate name for these would be herbal infusions, but they are often called tea because they are brewed in the same way as tea. Herbal teas are very popular and if you're American this is likely what you think of when you think of tea.

## How to make tea

For the most common teas that you are likely to encounter, these steps are all that's needed for a great brew.

1. Heat water. For darker teas like black teas, the water should be boiling temperature, not just warm. For lighter teas like green tea, the water should be hot but not quite boiling. An electric or stovetop kettle is the best tool for this (not a microwave).
2. Put the tea bag in the cup or the loose leaves into a tea strainer and then into the cup.
3. When the water is hot, pour it in the cup.
4. After 3-5 minutes for the darker teas (black, dark, herbal, and most oolongs), or 1-2 minutes for the lighter teas (green, white, yellow), remove the tea from the water. **This is important.** If the tea is left to brew for longer than this, it will quickly become bitter.
5. Sit back and enjoy!
