# Types of Tea

Although they are all made from the same plant, the subtle differences in different types of tea are endless, which is why tea is so fascinating to explore. However, if you're new to tea, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the wide variety.

Fortunately, as mentioned in the previous section, there are seven main categories of tea. These categories range on a spectrum from lighter teas like white and green tea on one end and darker teas like black tea on the other end. Becoming familiar with these categories is a good way to find your place in the world of tea no matter what you're brewing.

## Black Tea

Black teas tend to be a rich, dark brown color with a robust flavor. Common examples of black tea include:

* Assam – Tea from the Assam region of India.
* Ceylon – Tea from the Ceylon region of India.
* Darjeeling – Tea from the Darjeeling district in West Bengal, India.
* Keemun – Tea from Anhui Province of China.
* Dian Hong – Tea from the Yunnan Province of China.

Individual types of black tea are also often combined with other types to create blends, or are flavored with other ingredients to create other types:

* English breakfast, Irish breakfast – Blends of a variety of types of black teas, such as Assam and Ceylon.
* Masala chai – Black tea flavored with Indian spices and herbs.
* Earl grey – Black tea scented with bergamot.

Black tea is made from the leaves of the tea plant, *Camellia sinensis*, which go through a process of withering, rolling, oxidizing, and drying, with differences in the process producing different types of tea. The key difference between black tea production and the production of other types of tea is that the leaves are fully oxidized which gives the tea its strong flavor and dark color.

## Green Tea

Green teas tend to be a more delicate flavor and color compared to black teas. Green tea is produced in many countries in Asia, but the main types of Green tea originated in China and Japan. Some common examples of green teas include:

### Japanese

* Sencha – The most popular green tea in Japan,
* Matcha –
* Bancha
* Kukicha
* Gyokuro

### Chinese

* Dragonwell
* Gunpowder
* Jasmine

Green tea is also made from the *Camellia sinensis* plant, and goes through a similar production process as black tea, but in general the leaves are less processed and less oxidized which gives green tea its more delicate and subtle flavor.

## Oolong Tea

Oolong tea is in between black and green teas in taste. This category of tea has the most variations in processing techniques and thus the most variations in taste because of the wide range of oxidation levels. Oolong teas are usually rolled into thin tubes or beads. Of the many types of oolong teas, some of the most common include:

* Tie Guanyin

## White Tea

White tea tends to be minimally processed, very delicate in flavor, and made from the young leaves of the tea plant. It is primarily harvested in China. Some common examples of white teas include:

* Silver Needle
* White Peony

## Yellow Tea

Yellow tea is less common than other types of teas. The tea has a distinct yellow appearance and smell and follows a similar production process to green tea.

## Dark Tea

Dark teas are unique in that they are not only dried and oxidized but are also fermented. This gives the tea an earthy flavor.

## Herbal Tea

Herbal teas are the only teas not made from the *Camellia sinensis* plant. There is no common flavor characteristic between herbal teas because they are all made from different plants even though they are prepared and steeped in similar ways. Some common herbal teas include:

* Peppermint
