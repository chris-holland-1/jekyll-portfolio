If you're new to tea, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the wide variety of teas available. The subtle differences are endless, which is why tea is so fascinating to explore. However, as mentioned in the previous section, there are really seven main categories of tea. These categories range on a spectrum from lighter teas like white or green tea on one end and darker teas like black teas on the other end. There may be endless variations within these categories, but as long as you are familiar with the main types it won't feel so overwhelming.
