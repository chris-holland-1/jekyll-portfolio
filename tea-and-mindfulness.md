The health benefits of tea are highly debated. The centenarians in the Blue Zones drink tea all day, every day.

But there's a more subtle health benefit to drinking tea, one that cannot be denied, and may be the key to the health benefits of tea that have to do with nutrition. The mental benefit of mindfulness. Tea may be healthy on its own, but the mental state surrounding tea is an important factor that works with the physical properties of tea, and may be even more important.

Tea is a drink of the moment. To make tea, you have to slow down. You have to be patient. It does not work or push, it invites your mind to settle into a state of calm awareness.
